## Key Routes

- `/` - Landing page with lead form
- `/thanks` - Post-submission success page
- `/admin/leads` - Password-protected admin dashboard
- `/api/leads` - POST endpoint for lead submission
- `/api/admin/leads` - GET endpoint for admin (requires auth)

## Data Storage

Leads are stored in **Supabase** (PostgreSQL), providing a full-featured database with admin UI.

### Setting up Supabase

1. Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to the **SQL Editor** in your project dashboard
4. Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` to create the `leads` table
5. Go to **Project Settings** → **API** to get your credentials:
   - Copy **Project URL** → use as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Copy **service_role** key → use as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
6. Add these environment variables to your deployment platform

### Local Development

For local development, use the same Supabase credentials in your `.env.local` file.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub (already done!)

2. Import the project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)

3. Configure environment variables:
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Your admin dashboard password
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_PHONE` - Phone number displayed on site
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Your Supabase service role key
   - (Optional) `RESEND_API_KEY`, `LEADS_NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO`, `LEADS_NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM`
   - (Optional) `VAPI_API_KEY`, `VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `VAPI_NOTIFY_PHONE`
   - (Optional) `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`

4. Click "Deploy"

### Other Platforms

This is a standard Next.js app and can be deployed to:
- Netlify
- Railway
- Render
- Any Node.js hosting

Ensure you configure environment variables on your chosen platform.

## Development

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Type Check

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Admin Dashboard

Access the admin dashboard at `/admin/leads`. You'll be prompted for the password configured in `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

Features:
- View all lead submissions in a table
- Click any lead to view full details
- See urgency levels, contact info, and notes
- Responsive design

## Notifications

When a lead is submitted:

1. Lead is saved to Supabase (PostgreSQL)
2. If configured, email notification is sent via Resend
3. If configured, voice call notification is made via VAPI
4. If configured, JSON payload is POSTed to webhook URL
5. User is redirected to `/thanks`

All notifications run asynchronously and won't block the user experience if they fail.

**Voice Call Details:** When VAPI is configured, you'll receive an automated phone call reading out the lead details including passenger name, route, urgency level, and contact information. All calls are logged to Supabase with status tracking (initiated, in-progress, completed, failed).

**Call Logging:** Phone calls are tracked in the `call_logs` table with status updates via VAPI webhooks. You can view call history for each lead in the admin dashboard.

## Customization

### Branding

- Update colors in `app/globals.css` (current accent: `#ff6b35`)
- Modify copy in component files
- Replace contact phone in `.env.local`

### Form Fields

- Edit `types/lead.ts` for data model
- Update `lib/validations.ts` for Zod schema
- Modify `components/LeadForm.tsx` for UI
- Adjust `lib/notifications.ts` for notification content

### Design

All components use Tailwind CSS. Key colors:
- Background: `#1a1a1a`
- Secondary: `#242424`
- Accent: `#ff6b35`
- Text: `#ffffff`

## Security Notes

- Admin authentication is basic (password-only) - suitable for MVP
- For production, consider adding rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add CAPTCHA if you experience spam
- Review and sanitize all user inputs (Zod validation is in place)
- Keep `ADMIN_PASSWORD` secure and use a strong value

## Legal & Compliance

The site includes appropriate disclaimers about:
- Broker status (not an operator)
- Subject-to-availability language
- No guaranteed timelines
- Part 135 operator partnerships

Review and customize footer disclaimers in `components/Footer.tsx` to match your legal requirements.
